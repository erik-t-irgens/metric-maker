# Metric Maker

#### _This application is intended to provide a simple congregate data visualizer for metrics on given websites, where that information may be difficult to parse otherwise._

#### _By **Erik Irgens**_

## Description

This application is designed to accomplish the following, in short:

1. Scrape provided web page for metrics data, such as percentages, frequency, or comparative data.
2. Using the metrics data, provide a user-friendly data visualization for parsing
3. Provide references to the original data source for human readable accuracy.

### Component definitions:

<!-- 1 - Welcome - This will serve as the introductory landing area for the webpage,with a brief description and a visual grab for viewers. 
    * Starfield - A slightly interactable section which will contain stars and constellations as a visual grab.
2 - Portfolio - This section will contain clickable elements that lead to github repositories or live sites, and hopefully will have some sort of i-frame for each. 
3 - About - An about me section, potentially to be concatenated with the "Skills" section. 
    * Image Carousel - Show off certain images that encompass me as a person.
4 - Blog - A section that will contain clickable blog summaries that will lead to another site, with extensive blog articles that I've written. 
5 - Skills - A section with infographics about my skills. Dependant on verbosity. 
6 - Contact - A section with a box to email me directly. 
7 - Header - A header with links that will scroll the user to the specified section (listed above)
8 - Footer - Auxiliary links, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and GitHub.  -->


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
